Hello, human! My name is Experiment 369. I’ve just escaped from a lab run by evil scientists who plan to unleash a terrifying weapon upon the world: powerful Evil Kamikaze Nuke Drones. I need your help to stop them!

Oh no, they’ve found me! They’ll be here soon!

Listen closely, as time is short. I can’t fight, but I can grant you a special ability—laser eyes!

Whenever you find a blue-lit area in your room, run to it. Standing in the blue light will give you a 15-second superpower. Use your laser eyes to fight off the invading aliens and protect our world.

Remember, your superpower only affects the aliens; your home remains safe from harm.

Prepare yourself, brave human. The fate of the world is in your hands!
